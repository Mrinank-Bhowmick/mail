h2oai,browser-use,Make websites accessible for AI agents,hasithj,Hasith Perera,hasithjp@gmail.com,"Subject: Improving Memory for AI Agents in browser-use?  Hi Hasith,  Came across your project `browser-use` at h2oai, focused on making websites accessible for AI agents. It's a fascinating goal that relies heavily on robust context.  Mem0 is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI experiences that save costs and delight users. For browser-use, this means your agents could:  *   **Enhance Future Interactions:** Learn from past browsing sessions, retaining context across pages. *   **Save Money:** Filter website content, sending only relevant info to the LLM (Save costs up to 80%). *   **Improve Agent Outputs:** Deliver more accurate actions by leveraging historical context.  It's also **Easy Integration**, compatible with OpenAI, Claude, and more.  Would you be open to trying Mem0 in the browser-use codebase? Or perhaps a quick demo?  Best regards,  The mem0 Team Learn more: https://mem0.ai/"
NVIDIA,AgentIQ,The NVIDIA AgentIQ toolkit is an open-source library for efficiently connecting and optimizing teams of AI agents.,aflat,George Stockfisch,ghstock@gmail.com,"Subject: Enhance memory capabilities in AgentIQ with Mem0  Hi George,  I came across your work on the NVIDIA AgentIQ toolkit – the open-source library for efficiently connecting and optimizing teams of AI agents sounds like a fantastic resource.  Given AgentIQ's focus on agent collaboration, I thought you might find Mem0 interesting. Mem0 is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, designed to enable more personalized AI experiences.  Integrating Mem0 could help AgentIQ agents:  *   **Enhance Future Conversations:** Build smarter agents that learn from every interaction, providing context-rich responses without repetitive questions, potentially improving agent-to-agent or agent-to-user interactions. *   **Improve AI Responses:** Deliver more accurate and personalized agent outputs by leveraging historical context. *   **Save Money:** Potentially reduce LLM costs by up to 80% through intelligent data filtering when agents interact with models.  Mem0 offers Easy Integration, compatible with major models you likely use.  Would you be open to exploring how Mem0 could enhance the memory capabilities within AgentIQ? You can try it in your codebase or schedule a quick demo here: https://mem0.ai/  Best,  mem0"
langflow-ai,langflow,Langflow is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows.,italojohnny,Ítalo Johnny,italojohnnydosanjos@gmail.com,"Subject: Mem0: Memory Layer for Langflow Agents?  Hi Ítalo Johnny,  I've been following the amazing work you're doing with langflow-ai/langflow. Langflow is indeed a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows.  I wanted to briefly share Mem0, a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI experiences that save costs and delight users. Given Langflow's focus on building AI agents, Mem0 seems like a natural fit to enhance the workflows created.  With Mem0, these agents could easily remember user preferences, adapts to individual needs, and continuously improves over time. This helps reduce LLM costs by up to 80% through intelligent data filtering and deliver more accurate and personalized AI outputs by leveraging historical context and user preferences. It's designed for easy integration with existing AI solutions like those built with Langflow.  I'd love for you to explore how Mem0 could fit into a Langflow component or workflow. You can try integrating it directly or we could schedule a quick 15-minute chat.  Best,  mem0 https://mem0.ai/"
agntcy,csit,Continuous System Integration Testing for Agntcy Projects,muscariello,Luca Muscariello,lumuscar@cisco.com,"Subject: Enhancing AI Tested with csit  Hi Luca,  Came across your work on `agntcy/csit`, specifically the Continuous System Integration Testing for Agntcy Projects.  We've built Mem0, a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications. It helps projects remember interaction history and context, enabling personalized AI experiences that save costs and improve performance.  For the AI systems you test with `csit`, Mem0 can help improve AI responses by leveraging historical context and potentially reduce LLM costs by up to 80% through intelligent data filtering. It's designed for easy integration with platforms like OpenAI, Claude, and more.  If this sounds interesting, would you be open to trying it out in your codebase or seeing a quick demo?

IBM,ITBench-CISO-CAA-Agent,Code repository for CISO agent as part of ITBench,jjasghar,JJ Asghar,awesome@ibm.com,"Subject: Improving your ITBench CISO Agent with Memory  Hi JJ,  I came across your work on the `ITBench-CISO-CAA-Agent` repository at IBM, building that CISO agent as part of ITBench.  We've built Mem0, a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications like yours, that could significantly enhance it. For your agent, it could help *Enhance Future Conversations* by remembering user preferences and providing context-rich responses without repetitive questions. It can also *Save Money*, reducing LLM costs by up to 80% through intelligent data filtering.  Would you be open to trying Mem0 in the codebase, or perhaps a quick 15-minute demo?
